Hello, my name is Duc Anh Lai, and I am currently a PhD candidate in Dr. Devin Matthews' lab.
Lately, I've found myself with some free time, and I've noticed my enthusiam and motivation waning. To reignite my passion and keep my self actively engage in reading and writing, I decided to start this personal blog. As a result, this blog was born.
My initial idea will focus on writing some fundamental materials I learned during my coursework at SMU, particularly those related to electronic structure theory. I will also share updates on some of my current research projects and write about other topics that trigger my curiosity. 
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect!

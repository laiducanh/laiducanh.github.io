In chemistry, orbitals are often visualized as isosurfaces, which are surfaces of constant value representing the probability density of finding an electron. Since this concept commonly appears in various contexts of chemistry, I added a section to the article [Orbitals of a Hydrogen atom](https://laiducanh.github.io/posts/orbitals-of-a-hydrogen-atom/) that represents one way to plot isodensity surfaces for hydrogenic orbitals. While this additional section demonstrates a "pythonic" approach to draw 3d surface of electron density, it is not considered as the conventional method typically used in the chemical context for representing isosurfaces.

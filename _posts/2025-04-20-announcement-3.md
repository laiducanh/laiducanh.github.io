I'm excited to share that I'll be attending the ACS DFW MiM 2025, taking place on April 26 at Texas A&M University, Commerce, TX. The conference is held each spring by the ACS DFW local section, and provides valuable-and free-opporturnity for both undergrad and grad students to present their research. Beyond the science, it's a great chance to connect with professors, postdocts, and fellow chemists from the Dallas Fort Worth region. My lab, Matthews Research Group at SMU, participates every year to gain presentation experience and share our lastest work. I'll be presenting my electric field project in Session 1 (Physical I), right after a postdoc in our lab, Dr. Daniel Devore. Catch my talk at 11:45am (P10), it's the final presentation of the morning session!

If you'll be there too, I'd love to connect!

I'll be attending SETCA 2025 in Memphis from May 8-10. This is an annual meeting of all theoretical chemists from across the southeastern region in the US. My PI, Dr. Devin Matthews, will be giving a talk on Tensor hypercontraction (THC), and most of our group members, including myself as well, will be presenting posters. Unlike the [last conference](https://laiducanh.github.io/posts/announcement-3/), I'll show some work from my current project on the local symmetry and chirality from electronic structure theory. 

If youâ€™re planning to attend as well, let's chat theory, posters, and connect!
